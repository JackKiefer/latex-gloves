**latex-gloves** is a command-line software suite for the automatic creation of auto-graded Canvas quizzes for mathematics courses. 

latex-gloves allows an entire quiz to be defined in a collaborative Overleaf document. The program automates: generating individual images for each question; uploading the images to Canvas; creating question groups; and creating multiple-choice, numeric-answer, matrix, and essay quiz questions.

4.  Copy the token.
5.  Create a file called ``key.txt`` in the ``resources/`` directory, paste the token into it, and save. Make sure the file has only one line and that there are no other characters. 

# User guide

## Step 1: Structuring the quiz and formatting questions

Each quiz should be contained in a single master TeX file (usually in Overleaf to allow for collaboration) consisting of a **master header**, any number of **questions**, and a **master footer**. 

Each question in the quiz is automatically assigned to be worth 1 point. At the moment, there is no way to change this behavior; different point scales must be manually assigned. 

### Master headers and question headers
The each header is simply a LaTeX preamble consisting of the document declaration, package includes, and any custom declarations. 

The **master header** is the preamble of the master TeX file containing every question. The following is an example of a fairly minimal master header; note the document class  and environment begins:

```latex
%%% Document class for the master TeX file
\documentclass[answers]{exam}

%%% Package includes
\usepackage{amsmath}
%%% Custom commands
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}

%%% Begin questions environment
\begin{document}
\raggedright
\begin{questions}
```

The **question header** is the preamble that is used to generate each individual question image. It is defined in ``resources/questionPreamble.tex``. It is of a different document class and geometry, but the package-includes and custom commands should be the same. Like so:

```latex
%%% Document class for each question file
\documentclass[convert={outext=.png}, class=exam, border=20pt, varwidth]{standalone}

%%% Package includes
\usepackage{amsmath}
%%% Custom commands
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\boldsymbol{#1}}

%%% Begin single question environment
\begin{document}
```

### Master footers and question footers

Similar to the headers, the **master footer** and **question footer** are simply the LaTeX footers of the master and question TeX files, respectively. 

The master footer is usually just:

```latex
\end{questions}
\end{document}
```

while the question footer, defined in ``resources/questionPreamble.tex``, is usually simply:

```latex
\end{document}
```

### Formatting questions

All questions have several standard components. Consider the following example of a numeric question:

```latex
\question%c01s02n08b.tex
%type: numeric

\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n08b
\vspace{1em}

Given $x^2 = 81$, solve for $x$.

\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}

\begin{solution}
$9, -9$
\end{solution}

\newpage
```

Let's break down each component.

```latex
\question%c01s02n08b.tex
%type: numeric
```

This is the question declaration. It says we're creating a numeric-answer question with the unique ID ``c01s02n08b``, code for "chapter 1, section 2, problem number 8, variant b." Except for the "variant" indicator, it doesn't matter what the code itself is; you are free to use whatever system you like.

The inclusion of the lower-case "variant" letter at the end of the code indicates that the question is a member of a group. That is, should there also exist questions ``c01s02n08a`` and ``c01s02n08c``, all three questions will be placed into a question group from which only one will be randomly selected and shown to the quiz-taking student. 

```latex
\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n08b
\vspace{1em}
```

These are simply some graphical elements that place today's date, the question ID, and some spacing before the content of the question. It is generally handy to include this to keep track of each question as the semesters go by. Feel free to edit or delete this. 


```latex
Given $x^2 = 81$, solve for $x$.
```

The seitan of the question! Any and all LaTeX is valid here. That's right, throw in all the equations, tables, matrices, graphs, and cat pictures that your heart desires. If it compiles, it works!

```latex
\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}
```

This is more graphical fiddling that adds a horizontal line to separate the question body from the solutions. Again: handy, but not strictly neccesarry. Modify to your content.



```latex
\begin{solution}
$9, -9$
\end{solution}
```

The solution! The format of this changes depending on which question type we're dealing with (see below), but the solutions always show up after the question body. 

```latex
\newpage
```

The all-important ``\newpage``! This _must_ go at the end of all question blocks (including the last one) in order for latex-gloves to know to stop grabbing lines for the current question. 

#### Numeric-answer questions
Numeric-answer questions support multiple correct answers and allow for an acceptable margin of error. Each correct answer should be separated by a comma (,). The ``\pm`` operator (±) allows each answer to be given an appropriate bound. 

Here, we're asking for the square root of one ninth. We indicate that acceptable answers are ``0.333`` and ``-0.333`` with an error margin of ``0.01`` (that way, answers like ``0.33`` and ``-0.333333333`` are still accepted):

```latex
\question%c01s02n08c.tex
%type: numeric

\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n08c
\vspace{1em}

Given $x^2 = \frac{1}{9}$, solve for $x$.

\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}

\begin{solution}
$0.333 \pm 0.01, 0.333 \pm 0.01$
\end{solution}

\newpage
```

This is about as complex as a numeric solution gets. If an error margin of 0 is desired, the ``\pm`` may be omitted. For example, the solution to ``What is 2*2?``" might simply look like:

```latex
\begin{solution}
$4$
\end{solution}
```

#### Multiple-choice questions
Multiple choice questions support up to 26 possible choices in accordance with the alphabet (heaven have mercy on the students who must answer such a question). Choices are dynamically generated using the ``choices`` environment. The correct choice is simply indicated using the ``\CorrectChoice`` command. Choices are displayed in the order that you list them and are not randomized.

Note that, in the Overleaf preview, the correct choice will be bolded for you to easily keep track of it. Worry not; when the question is rendered by itself, the bold will go away. 

```latex
\question%c01s02n09a.tex
%type: multiple_choice

\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n09a
\vspace{1em}

Which of the following lines are parallel to $y = 3x + 3$?

\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}

\begin{choices}
    \choice         $y = 2x + 3$
    \choice         $y = 2x + 2$
    \CorrectChoice  $y = 3x + 2$
    \choice         $y = 9x + 9$
\end{choices}

\newpage
```

#### Essay questions

Essay questions, of course, cannot be automatically graded. For this question type, the ``solution`` field is optional, but you may wish to use it to include helpful info for whoever is grading the question by hand:

```latex
\question%c01s02n19.tex
%type: essay

\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n19
\vspace{1em}

Which of Leonhard Euler's contributions to mathematics is your favorite, and why?

\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}

\begin{solution}
    Some examples are $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$, the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, the totient function, etc.
    Points are not awarded for contributions not made by Euler.
\end{solution}

\newpage
```

#### Matrix-answer questions (experimental)

This experimental question type allows for the answers of questions to be entire matrices (useful for courses in Linear Algebra). The question type is experimental, as it is not officially supported by Canvas; rather, it is our own concoction. 

Under the hood, the matrix-answer is simply a fill-in-the-blank question with a grid of required blanks to fill in. As per the section below on fill-in-the-blank questions, use with extreme caution. It is wisest to keep each entry an simple integer.

Matrices like these are graded element-by-element. A totally complete and correct matrix is worth 1 point. A matrix with no correct entries is 0 points. A matrix with two-thirds of the entries correct is 0.66 points. Et cetera. It does not matter how large the matrix is.

The solution is formatted as an ``array``:


```latex
\question%c01s02n20a.tex
%type: matrix

\hfill \today
\hfill c01s02n20a
\vspace{1em}

What is the 3x3 identity matrix?

\vspace{1em}
{\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}}

\begin{solution}
$
    \begin{array}{rrr}
        1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1
    \end{array}
$
\end{solution}

\newpage
```

## Step 2: Parsing and uploading the quiz to Canvas

### Quick command reference
```
python texParser.py main.tex
python convert.py
python gloves.py
```

### i) Environment setup
1.  In the Overleaf project, first ensure that the document is compiling with no errors, and that all lines commented out with a ``\begin{comment}`` command have been deleted or converted to the ``%`` comment style.
2.  Click ``Menu > Download > Source`` to download a zip file of the project.
3.  Extract the contents of the zip file to the same directory that latex-gloves is installed (e.g., ``C:\Users\2250\Desktop\latex-gloves-master``
4.  Open up a command terminal.
5.  Navigate to the latex-gloves directory within the command prompt using the ``cd`` (change directory) command. E.g., run ``cd C:\Users\2250\Desktop\latex-gloves-master`` if you're on Windows.

### ii) Splitting the master file into individual .tex files
1.  Ensure that all packages you plan on using are indicated in the header file, ``resources/questionPreamble.tex``. This block of TeX is included at the start of all individual tex files. Similarly, ``resources/latexClosure.tex`` is included at the end of each tex file if you need to make any adjustments there.
2.  Pass the main TeX file (e.g., ``main.tex``) into the TeX parser by running ``python texParser.py main.tex``. _Note:_ For this to work, ``main.tex`` and ``texParser.py`` must be in the same folder.
3.  At this time, the TeX parser will inform you of any parsing errors that it encounters. If errors are encountered, they must be fixed within the TeX file by the user. See the section above on question syntax.

### iii) Converting to PNGs
1.  Simply run ``python convert.py`` to begin the conversion process. Hopefully, since your document compiled without error on Overleaf, the questions will be compiled without error here, as well. In any case, a bunch of very verbose output will be spit onto the screen by ``pdflatex``, and it will indicate any compiler errors that need be fixed.

### iv) Upload to Canvas
1.  Open up ``gloves.py`` in your favorite text editor.
2.  Change ``folderPath`` to the path in Canvas's file system you'd like to upload the quizz's images to, e.g. ``/quizzes/chapter1``. Make sure this path begins with a leading ``/``.
3.  Create an empty quiz in Canvas, and change ``quizURL`` to the quiz's URL. It should look something like ``https://xxx.instructure.com/courses/xxxxx/quizzes/xxxxx``.
4.  Cross your fingers and run ``python gloves.py``!



# Parsing errors
These errors begin with "**Parse error in above LaTex block while locating:...**". The errors mean that latex-gloves attempted to use a regex to find a particular element, but was unable to. Be sure to check for spelling mistakes and missing/extraneous characters.


| Parse error in above LaTeX block while locating... | Description |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| ``questions``                        | The ``\question%code.tex`` and corresponding ``\newpage`` directives could not be found  |
| ``question type``                    | The ``%type: `` directive following the question declaration could not be found  |
| ``solution``                         | The ``\begin{solution}`` and corresponding ``\end{solution}`` directives could not be found  |
| ``matrix solution``                  | The question is of type ``matrix`` and the ``\begin{array}`` and corresponding ``\end{array}`` directives could not be found  |
| ``multiple choice options``          | The question is of type ``multiple_choice`` and the ``\begin{choices}`` and corresponding ``\end{choices}`` directives could not be found  |
| ``correct multiple choice response`` | The question is of type ``multiple_choice`` and the ``choices`` environment was found, but a ``\CorrectChoice`` could not be located   |


# Why no fill-in-the-blank questions?

Automating fill-in-the-blank questions is a very, very bad idea. We've tried it before. It was awful. Never do it. Ever. 

Consider the following example:

```
A rectangle is formed on the XY-plane. 
Three of its corners are defined by (0,0), (0, 1/3), and (1/2, 0).
Where is its fourth corner?
```

Clearly, the answer is simply ``(1/2, 1/3)``. Now, this is a fine answer format for a handwritten test. Unfortunately, this is a veritable nightmare trying to encode into Canvas. 

Fill-in-the-blank questions in Canvas are not "smart;" to get the answer correct, what the student inputs must match one of the possible answers _character-for-character_. This quickly explodes into a huge variety of different possible answers that are all correct and mathematically equivalent, but using different characters (and yes, _spaces_ count as characters, too):

* ``(1/2, 1/3)``
* ``(0.5, 0.33)``
* ``(0.50, 0.333)``
* ``1/2, 1/3``
* ``0.5, 0.33``
* ``0.50, 0.333``
* ``x=1/2, y=1/3``
* ``x = 1/2, y = 1/3``
* ``(1/2,1/3)``
* ``(0.5,0.33)``
* ``(0.50,0.333)``
* ``1/2,1/3``
* ``0.5,0.33``
* ``0.50,0.333``
* ``x=1/2,y=1/3``
* ``x = 1/2,y = 1/3``

I'm sure you can imagine even more entries in the above list.

You might think that maybe, _just maybe_, you can provide specific-enough instructions to wrangle students into a consistent answer format. You might think that _your_ students are smart enough to figure it out. You are wrong. You are more wrong than you realize. Never underestimate the creative stupidity of a human being. Okay, you specify, "include parentheses, express all numbers as fractions in their lowest terms, and do not include a space anywhere in the coordinate pair." So, a student complies, and writes ``The fourth corner is located at (1/2,1/3)``. They are marked wrong by the auto-grader. The student is upset. Their parents angrily call the president of the university demanding a grade change _this instant_. Your palm flies through your face. It will happen.

Fill-in-the-blank answers are a bad idea. Don't do it. Don't even think about it.

If you really, _really_, and I mean _really really_ want a fill-in-the-blank question that isn't a math question, like "What city was the Pascal programming language created in?", then, by all means, input it manually into Canvas. Latex-gloves will not be responsible for your blunder. Just be sure to include all of the possible answers of ``Zurich``, ``Zürich``, ``Zurich, Switzerland``, ``Zurich,Switzerland``, ``Zürich, Switzerland``, and ``Zürich,Switzerland``.
